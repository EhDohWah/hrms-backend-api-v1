# Frontend Migration Checklist: Department & Position Separation

## üéØ **Migration Overview**

This checklist helps frontend developers migrate from the old `department_positions` implementation to the new separated `departments` and `positions` system.

---

## ‚úÖ **Pre-Migration Audit**

### 1. Identify Old References
- [ ] Search codebase for `department_position` references
- [ ] Find components using old API endpoints
- [ ] Locate hardcoded department/position combinations
- [ ] Check for string-based department/position lookups

### 2. Inventory Affected Components
- [ ] Employee assignment forms
- [ ] Position selection dropdowns
- [ ] Department management interfaces
- [ ] Reporting/hierarchy displays
- [ ] Search and filter components

---

## üîÑ **API Endpoint Migration**

### Old vs New Endpoints

| **Functionality** | **Old Endpoint** | **New Endpoint** |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Get departments | `/department-positions?distinct=department` | `/departments` |
| Get positions | `/department-positions?distinct=position` | `/positions` |
| Get dept positions | `/department-positions?department={name}` | `/departments/{id}/positions` |
| Get managers | Manual filtering | `/departments/{id}/managers` |
| Position hierarchy | Not supported | `/positions/{id}/direct-reports` |

### 3. Update API Calls
- [ ] Replace old endpoint calls with new ones
- [ ] Update request parameters (string ‚Üí ID-based)
- [ ] Modify response parsing for new structure
- [ ] Add error handling for new validation rules

**Example Migration:**
```typescript
// OLD
const getDepartmentPositions = async (departmentName: string) => {
  return api.get(`/department-positions?department=${departmentName}`);
};

// NEW
const getDepartmentPositions = async (departmentId: number) => {
  return api.get(`/departments/${departmentId}/positions`);
};
```

### 4. Update Data Models
- [ ] Change department from string to object with ID
- [ ] Add position hierarchy fields (level, reports_to)
- [ ] Include manager relationship data
- [ ] Add active status tracking

**Example Type Updates:**
```typescript
// OLD
interface Employee {
  department_position_id: number;
  department_name: string;
  position_name: string;
}

// NEW
interface Employee {
  department_id: number;
  position_id: number;
  department: {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    is_active: boolean;
  };
  position: {
    id: number;
    title: string;
    level: number;
    is_manager: boolean;
    manager_name?: string;
  };
}
```

# EmployeeController Delete Methods Fix

## 🐛 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

The EmployeeController had a critical error in both single and bulk delete methods:

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "message": "Something went wrong",
    "error": "Class \"App\\Models\\EmployeeGrantAllocation\" not found"
}
```

## 🔧 **ROOT CAUSE**

1. **Wrong Model Import**: The controller was importing `EmployeeGrantAllocation` which doesn't exist
2. **Wrong Model Usage**: Using the non-existent model in delete operations
3. **Incomplete Cleanup**: Single delete method wasn't properly cleaning up related records

## ✅ **FIXES APPLIED**

### **1. Fixed Model Import**
```php
// BEFORE (Wrong)
use App\Models\EmployeeGrantAllocation;

// AFTER (Correct)
use App\Models\EmployeeFundingAllocation;
```

### **2. Updated Model Usage**
```php
// BEFORE (Wrong)
EmployeeGrantAllocation::whereIn('employee_id', $ids)->delete();

// AFTER (Correct)
EmployeeFundingAllocation::whereIn('employee_id', $ids)->delete();
```

### **3. Enhanced Single Delete Method**
**BEFORE**: Simple delete without proper cleanup
```php
public function destroy($id)
{
    $employee = Employee::find($id);
    if (!$employee) {
        return response()->json(['success' => false, 'message' => 'Employee not found'], 404);
    }
    
    $employee->delete(); // ❌ No cleanup of related records
    
    return response()->json(['success' => true, 'message' => 'Employee deleted successfully']);
}
```

**AFTER**: Comprehensive cleanup with transaction
```php
public function destroy($id)
{
    $employee = Employee::find($id);
    if (!$employee) {
        return response()->json(['success' => false, 'message' => 'Employee not found'], 404);
    }

    try {
        DB::beginTransaction();

        // ✅ Delete all related records first
        EmployeeFundingAllocation::where('employee_id', $id)->delete();
        EmployeeBeneficiary::where('employee_id', $id)->delete();
        EmployeeIdentification::where('employee_id', $id)->delete();
        EmployeeChild::where('employee_id', $id)->delete();
        EmployeeEducation::where('employee_id', $id)->delete();
        EmployeeLanguage::where('employee_id', $id)->delete();
        EmployeeTraining::where('employee_id', $id)->delete();
        EmploymentHistory::where('employee_id', $id)->delete();
        LeaveBalance::where('employee_id', $id)->delete();
        LeaveRequest::where('employee_id', $id)->delete();
        TravelRequest::where('employee_id', $id)->delete();
        Employment::where('employee_id', $id)->delete();

        // Delete the employee
        $employee->delete();

        DB::commit();

        return response()->json([
            'success' => true,
            'message' => 'Employee deleted successfully',
        ]);
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        DB::rollBack();
        Log::error('Failed to delete employee: '.$e->getMessage());

        return response()->json([
            'success' => false,
            'message' => 'Something went wrong',
            'error' => $e->getMessage(),
        ], 500);
    }
}
```

### **4. Enhanced Bulk Delete Method**
Updated `deleteSelectedEmployees` method with the same comprehensive cleanup:

```php
// Delete related records first to maintain referential integrity
// Note: Some tables have cascadeOnDelete, but we explicitly delete for better control
EmployeeFundingAllocation::whereIn('employee_id', $ids)->delete();
EmployeeBeneficiary::whereIn('employee_id', $ids)->delete();
EmployeeIdentification::whereIn('employee_id', $ids)->delete();
EmployeeChild::whereIn('employee_id', $ids)->delete();
EmployeeEducation::whereIn('employee_id', $ids)->delete();
EmployeeLanguage::whereIn('employee_id', $ids)->delete();
EmployeeTraining::whereIn('employee_id', $ids)->delete();
EmploymentHistory::whereIn('employee_id', $ids)->delete();
LeaveBalance::whereIn('employee_id', $ids)->delete();
LeaveRequest::whereIn('employee_id', $ids)->delete();
TravelRequest::whereIn('employee_id', $ids)->delete();
Employment::whereIn('employee_id', $ids)->delete();
```

## 📊 **RELATED MODELS CLEANED UP**

The delete methods now properly clean up all related records:

| Model | Relationship | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `EmployeeFundingAllocation` | `employee_id` | Employee funding allocations |
| `EmployeeBeneficiary` | `employee_id` | Employee beneficiaries |
| `EmployeeIdentification` | `employee_id` | Employee ID documents |
| `EmployeeChild` | `employee_id` | Employee children |
| `EmployeeEducation` | `employee_id` | Employee education records |

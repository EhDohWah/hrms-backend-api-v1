  the warning.

● I'll read the router index.js file to fix these Vue Router warnings.

● Read(D:\HR_management_system\3.
      Implementation\hrms-frontend-dev\src\router\index.js)
  ⎿  Read 1427 lines

● I can see the issue. The Vue Router warnings occur when a parent route has a
  name but also has a child with an empty path ('') that redirects. The fix is
  to remove the name from the parent routes that have redirect children, since
  the name on the parent doesn't render anything useful.

  Let me fix all 10 routes that have this issue:

● Fixed all 10 Vue Router warnings. The issue was that parent routes had names
  while also having children with empty paths (''). The fix moves the name from
  the parent to the redirect child route.

  Routes fixed:
  1. HrmAttendance - Attendance Management
  2. HrmLeaveAdmin - Leave Administration
  3. HrmMyLeave - My Leave
  4. HrmPerformance - Performance Management
  5. HrmGeneral - HR Management (Holidays/Resignations)
  6. PayrollManagement - Payroll & Finance
  7. GrantManagement - Grant Management
  8. RecruitmentManagement - Recruitment
  9. ReportManagement - Reports & Analytics
  10. UtilityPages - Utility Pages

  The change moves the route name from the parent to the redirect child, so:
  - router.push({ name: 'HrmAttendance' }) still works
  - The redirect happens correctly
  - The Vue Router warning is eliminated

  Refresh your browser to verify the warnings are gone.

● I'll read the router index.js file to fix these Vue Router warnings.

● Read(D:\HR_management_system\3.
      Implementation\hrms-frontend-dev\src\router\index.js)
  ⎿  Read 1427 lines

● I can see the issue. The Vue Router warnings occur when a parent route has a
  name but also has a child with an empty path ('') that redirects. The fix is
  to remove the name from the parent routes that have redirect children, since
  the name on the parent doesn't render anything useful.

  Let me fix all 10 routes that have this issue:

● Fixed all 10 Vue Router warnings. The issue was that parent routes had names
  while also having children with empty paths (''). The fix moves the name from
  the parent to the redirect child route.

  Routes fixed:
  1. HrmAttendance - Attendance Management
  2. HrmLeaveAdmin - Leave Administration
  3. HrmMyLeave - My Leave
  4. HrmPerformance - Performance Management
  5. HrmGeneral - HR Management (Holidays/Resignations)
  6. PayrollManagement - Payroll & Finance
  7. GrantManagement - Grant Management
  8. RecruitmentManagement - Recruitment
  9. ReportManagement - Reports & Analytics
  10. UtilityPages - Utility Pages

  The change moves the route name from the parent to the redirect child, so:
  - router.push({ name: 'HrmAttendance' }) still works
  - The redirect happens correctly
  - The Vue Router warning is eliminated

  Refresh your browser to verify the warnings are gone.

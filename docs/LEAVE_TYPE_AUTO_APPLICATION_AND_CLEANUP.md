# Leave Type Auto-Application & Traditional Leaves Cleanup

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Implemented

---

## Overview

This document describes two major improvements to the Leave Management System:

1. **Auto-Application of New Leave Types**: Automatically creates leave balance records for all existing employees when a new leave type is created
2. **Traditional Leaves Table Removal**: Eliminates redundant `traditional_leaves` table to simplify the data model

---

## 1. Auto-Application of New Leave Types to All Employees

### Business Requirement

When HR creates a new leave type (e.g., "Emergency Leave", "Study Leave"), the system should automatically:
- Create leave balance records for all existing employees
- Allocate the default number of days specified in the leave type
- Set up balances for the current year
- Return a count of how many employees received the new leave type

### Implementation Details

#### Modified Controller Method

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Api/LeaveManagementController.php`  
**Method:** `storeTypes()`  
**Lines:** 653-717

#### Key Features

1. **Transaction Safety**
   - Wrapped in `DB::beginTransaction()` and `DB::commit()`
   - Ensures atomicity: either all balances are created or none are
   - Rolls back on any error to maintain data integrity

2. **Balance Creation Logic**
   ```php
   // Auto-apply new leave type to all existing employees
   $employees = Employee::all();
   $currentYear = Carbon::now()->year;
   $balancesCreated = 0;
   $totalDays = $validated['default_duration'] ?? 0;

   foreach ($employees as $employee) {
       // Check if balance already exists to avoid duplicates
       $existingBalance = LeaveBalance::where('employee_id', $employee->id)
           ->where('leave_type_id', $leaveType->id)
           ->where('year', $currentYear)
           ->exists();

       if (!$existingBalance) {
           LeaveBalance::create([
               'employee_id' => $employee->id,
               'leave_type_id' => $leaveType->id,
               'total_days' => $totalDays,
               'used_days' => 0,
               'remaining_days' => $totalDays,
               'year' => $currentYear,
               'created_by' => auth()->user()->name ?? 'System',
           ]);
           $balancesCreated++;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Duplicate Prevention**
   - Checks for existing balance records before creation
   - Prevents duplicate balances for the same employee, leave type, and year
   - Leverages the unique constraint on `leave_balances` table

4. **Default Duration Handling**
   - Uses the leave type's `default_duration` if provided
   - Defaults to 0 days if `default_duration` is null or not specified
   - Appropriate for leave types like "Unpaid Leave" or "Other"

### API Changes

#### Endpoint
```
POST /api/leaves/types
```

#### Request Body (Unchanged)
```json
{
  "name": "Emergency Leave",
  "default_duration": 5,
  "description": "Emergency leave for unexpected situations",
  "requires_attachment": false
}
```

#### Enhanced Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Leave type created successfully and applied to 150 employees",
  "data": {
    "leave_type": {
      "id": 12,
      "name": "Emergency Leave",
      "default_duration": 5,
      "description": "Emergency leave for unexpected situations",
      "requires_attachment": false,
      "created_by": "System",
      "created_at": "2025-10-01T10:30:00.000000Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-10-01T10:30:00.000000Z"
    },
    "balances_created": 150
  }
}
```

#### Response Changes Summary

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `data.leave_type` | object | The created leave type object |
| `data.balances_created` | integer | Count of employee balance records created |
| `message` | string | Updated to include employee count |

### Swagger Documentation Updates

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Api/LeaveManagementController.php`  
**Lines:** 625-674

#### Enhanced Documentation Features

1. **Updated Summary**
   - "Create a new leave type and automatically apply to all existing employees"

2. **Detailed Description**
   - "Creates a new leave type and automatically creates leave balance records for all existing employees for the current year"

3. **Request Body Examples**
   - Added descriptive examples for each field
   - Clarified `default_duration` behavior

4. **Response Schema**
   - Documented the new nested structure with `leave_type` and `balances_created`
   - Added realistic example values

### Performance Considerations

1. **Batch Processing**
   - Current implementation processes employees sequentially
   - Suitable for typical organization sizes (up to 1,000 employees)
   - For larger organizations (10,000+ employees), consider:
     - Chunked processing: `Employee::chunk(100, function($employees) {...})`
     - Queue-based background jobs
     - Bulk insert operations

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Uses `exists()` instead of `first()` for duplicate checking (faster)
   - Single query per employee (N+1 is acceptable for this use case)
   - Consider eager loading if additional relationships are needed

### Error Handling

1. **Transaction Rollback**
   - Any exception during balance creation rolls back the entire operation
   - Leave type is not created if balance creation fails
   - Ensures data consistency

2. **Error Response**
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "message": "Failed to create leave type",
     "error": "Detailed error message"
   }
   ```

3. **Logging**
   - Errors logged to `storage/logs/laravel.log`
   - Includes exception message for debugging

---

## 2. Traditional Leaves Table Removal

### Rationale

The `traditional_leaves` table was redundant because:

1. **Functional Duplication**
   - Leave types table already includes "Traditional day-off" as a leave type
   - The `description` field in `leave_types` can store all necessary information
   - No unique functionality that couldn't be handled by existing tables

2. **Data Model Simplification**
   - Reduces number of tables to maintain
   - Eliminates confusion about where to store traditional holiday information
   - Simplifies database schema and relationships

3. **Consistency**
   - All leave-related data now follows the same pattern: Leave Type → Leave Balance → Leave Request
   - Traditional holidays are managed as regular leave requests
   - Unified reporting and analytics

### Implementation Changes

#### Migration File Changes

**File:** `database/migrations/2025_03_16_021936_create_leave_management_tables.php`

##### 1. Removed Table Creation (Lines 84-94)

**Before:**
```php
// Traditional Leaves - Keep as is
Schema::create('traditional_leaves', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->string('name', 100)->nullable();
    $table->text('description')->nullable();
    $table->date('date')->nullable();
    $table->dateTime('created_at')->nullable();
    $table->dateTime('updated_at')->nullable();
    $table->string('created_by')->nullable();
    $table->string('updated_by')->nullable();
});
```

**After:** Removed entirely

##### 2. Updated down() Method (Line 113)

**Before:**
```php
public function down()
{
    Schema::dropIfExists('leave_balances');
    Schema::dropIfExists('leave_requests');
    Schema::dropIfExists('traditional_leaves');  // ← Removed this line
    Schema::dropIfExists('leave_types');
}
```

**After:**
```php
public function down()
{
    Schema::dropIfExists('leave_balances');
    Schema::dropIfExists('leave_requests');
    Schema::dropIfExists('leave_types');
}
```

##### 3. Preserved "Traditional day-off" Leave Type

**File:** `database/migrations/2025_03_16_021936_create_leave_management_tables.php`  
**Method:** `seedLeaveTypes()`  
**Lines:** 142-149

The "Traditional day-off" leave type is still seeded with:
- **Name:** Traditional day-off
- **Default Duration:** 13 days
- **Description:** Traditional day-off /วันพุฒหาประเพณี (Specify Traditional day off/ระบุวันหยุด)
- **Requires Attachment:** false

#### Model Removal

**Deleted File:** `app/Models/TraditionalLeave.php`

**Previous Content:**
```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class TraditionalLeave extends Model
{
    protected $table = 'traditional_leaves';

    protected $fillable = [
        'name',
        'description',
        'date',
        'created_by',
        'updated_by',
    ];

    public $timestamps = true;
}
```

**Action:** File completely removed from codebase

### Migration Strategy

#### For Fresh Installations
- Migration runs cleanly without `traditional_leaves` table
- No action required

#### For Existing Systems

If `traditional_leaves` table exists with data:

1. **Before Updating Migration:**
   ```sql
   -- Check if there's data in traditional_leaves
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM traditional_leaves;
   ```

2. **If Data Exists:**
   - Export data: `mysqldump hrms_db traditional_leaves > traditional_leaves_backup.sql`
   - Migrate data to `leave_requests` table with `leave_type_id` = "Traditional day-off"
   - Drop the table manually: `DROP TABLE traditional_leaves;`

3. **Then Run Migration:**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
   ```

### How Traditional Holidays Work Now

#### Creating a Traditional Holiday Leave Request

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/leaves/requests`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "employee_id": 123,
  "leave_type_id": 3,  // "Traditional day-off" leave type ID
  "start_date": "2025-12-25",
  "end_date": "2025-12-25",
  "total_days": 1,
  "reason": "Christmas Day - Traditional Holiday",
  "status": "approved"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent with other leave types
- Automatically tracked in leave balance
- Same approval workflow available if needed
- Unified reporting and statistics

---

## Database Schema Changes Summary

### Tables Modified

#### `leave_balances` (No changes)
- Still creates balances for all leave types including "Traditional day-off"
- Unique constraint prevents duplicates: `['employee_id', 'leave_type_id', 'year']`

#### `leave_types` (No changes)
- Contains "Traditional day-off" as a seeded leave type
- All leave types use the same structure

### Tables Removed

#### `traditional_leaves`
- **Status:** Completely removed
- **Reason:** Redundant functionality
- **Alternative:** Use `leave_requests` with `leave_type_id` pointing to "Traditional day-off"

---

## Testing Guidelines

### 1. Test Auto-Application Feature

#### Test Case 1: Create Leave Type with Default Duration
```bash
POST /api/leaves/types
{
  "name": "Study Leave",
  "default_duration": 10,
  "description": "Leave for educational purposes",
  "requires_attachment": false
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Leave type created successfully
- Response includes `balances_created` count matching total active employees
- All employees have a new `leave_balance` record with 10 total days

**Verification:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leave_balances 
WHERE leave_type_id = [new_leave_type_id] 
AND year = YEAR(CURDATE());
```

#### Test Case 2: Create Leave Type with NULL Default Duration
```bash
POST /api/leaves/types
{
  "name": "Special Leave",
  "default_duration": null,
  "description": "Special circumstances leave",
  "requires_attachment": true
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Leave type created successfully
- All employees have balance records with 0 total days
- `balances_created` count matches total active employees

#### Test Case 3: Transaction Rollback
```bash
# Simulate error by creating duplicate leave type name
POST /api/leaves/types
{
  "name": "Annual Leave",  // Already exists
  "default_duration": 20
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Request fails with validation error
- No new leave type created
- No new balance records created
- Database remains in consistent state

### 2. Test Traditional Leaves Removal

#### Test Case 1: Fresh Migration
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

**Expected Result:**
- Migration runs without errors
- `traditional_leaves` table does not exist
- `leave_types` table contains "Traditional day-off" entry
- No references to `TraditionalLeave` model in codebase

**Verification:**
```sql
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'traditional_leaves';  -- Should return empty
SELECT * FROM leave_types WHERE name = 'Traditional day-off';  -- Should return 1 row
```

#### Test Case 2: Create Traditional Holiday Request
```bash
POST /api/leaves/requests
{
  "employee_id": 1,
  "leave_type_id": 3,  // Traditional day-off
  "start_date": "2025-12-25",
  "end_date": "2025-12-25",
  "total_days": 1,
  "reason": "Christmas Day",
  "status": "approved"
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Leave request created successfully
- Employee's "Traditional day-off" balance decremented by 1 day
- Request appears in leave request list with proper leave type name

   ```php
   Employee::chunk(100, function ($employees) use ($leaveType, $currentYear) {
       $balances = [];
       foreach ($employees as $employee) {
           $balances[] = [
               'employee_id' => $employee->id,
               'leave_type_id' => $leaveType->id,
               'total_days' => $totalDays,
               'used_days' => 0,
               'remaining_days' => $totalDays,
               'year' => $currentYear,
               'created_by' => auth()->user()->name ?? 'System',
           ];
       }
       LeaveBalance::insert($balances);
   });
   ```

2. **Queue-Based Background Processing**
   ```php
   dispatch(new ApplyLeaveTypeToEmployees($leaveType, $currentYear));
   ```

3. **Employee Filtering Options**
   - Apply only to specific departments
   - Apply only to specific employment types
   - Apply only to employees hired before a certain date

4. **Historical Leave Type Application**
   - Option to apply to previous years
   - Bulk year selection for leave type application

5. **Notification System**
   - Notify employees when new leave types are available
   - Email notifications for balance updates

## Rollback Procedure

### If Issues Are Encountered

#### 1. Restore Traditional Leaves Table
```php
// Create new migration: 2025_10_01_restore_traditional_leaves.php
Schema::create('traditional_leaves', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->string('name', 100)->nullable();
    $table->text('description')->nullable();
    $table->date('date')->nullable();
    $table->timestamps();
    $table->string('created_by')->nullable();
    $table->string('updated_by')->nullable();
});
```

#### 2. Revert Controller Changes
```bash
git revert [commit-hash]
```

#### 3. Remove Auto-Created Balances
```sql
-- Identify the leave type ID
SET @new_leave_type_id = [id];

-- Remove balances created for this leave type
DELETE FROM leave_balances 
WHERE leave_type_id = @new_leave_type_id 
AND created_at >= '[implementation_date]';
```

## 💰 Payroll Calculation Engine

### 1. Multi-Source Funding Allocation

**Business Logic:**
- Each employee can be funded by multiple sources (grants, organizational funds)
- Level of Effort (LOE) percentages must total 100%
- Each funding source generates a separate payroll record
- Costs are automatically distributed across funding sources

**Example Scenario:**
```
Employee: John Doe (SMRU)
Position Salary: ฿50,000/month
Funding Allocation:
├── Research Grant (BHF): 60% LOE = ฿30,000
└── General Fund (SMRU): 40% LOE = ฿20,000
Total: 100% LOE = ฿50,000 ✓
```

### 2. Salary Calculation Components

#### Base Salary Determination
```
Position Salary: ฿50,000
├── Probation Period Handling
│   ├── Before probation pass: Uses probation_salary
│   ├── After probation pass: Uses position_salary
│   └── Mid-month transition: Pro-rated calculation
├── Annual Increase (1% after 365 working days)
└── FTE Adjustment (Full-time Equivalent percentage)
```

#### Mid-Month Probation Transition — Pro-Rated Calculation
When an employee passes probation partway through a month, that month’s base salary is split between the probation salary and the full position salary based on day counts. This ensures fair pay for days worked at each rate.

Formula (Monthly Base):
```
daysInMonth = number of days in month (28–31)
probationDays = days from 1st up to and including probation_pass_date
positionDays  = daysInMonth - probationDays

dailyProbation = probation_salary / daysInMonth
dailyPosition  = position_salary  / daysInMonth

monthly_base = round(probationDays * dailyProbation + positionDays * dailyPosition, 2)
```

Example:
```
probation_salary = ฿40,000, position_salary = ฿50,000
probation_pass_date = 15th of a 31‑day month
probationDays = 15, positionDays = 16

dailyProbation = 40,000 / 31  ≈ 1,290.32 → 1,290.32 × 15 ≈ 19,354.84
dailyPosition  = 50,000 / 31  ≈ 1,612.90 → 1,612.90 × 16 ≈ 25,806.45
monthly_base   ≈ 45,161.29
```

Notes:
- If probation ended before the month starts → pay full position salary.
- If probation continues past month end → pay full probation salary.
- The pass date is included in probation days (new rate applies starting the next day).
- Works correctly for all month lengths (28/29/30/31 days).

Downstream impact:
- This monthly_base is then adjusted per allocation by LOE (Level of Effort), used for 13th‑month accrual eligibility, and feeds deductions (PVD/Saving, Social Security, Health Welfare) and Thai tax calculations.

#### Level of Effort Application
```
Adjusted Salary × LOE Percentage = Allocation Salary
฿50,000 × 60% = ฿30,000 (Grant portion)
฿50,000 × 40% = ฿20,000 (Org portion)
```

### 3. Thai Revenue Department Tax Compliance

#### Mandatory Calculation Sequence
```
Step 1: Employment Deductions (Applied FIRST)
├── Rate: 50% of annual income
├── Maximum: ฿100,000 per year
└── Law Reference: Revenue Code Section 42(1)

Step 2: Personal Allowances (Applied AFTER employment deductions)
├── Personal: ฿60,000
├── Spouse: ฿60,000 (if no spouse income)
├── Children: ฿30,000 first child, ฿60,000 subsequent (born 2018+)
├── Parents: ฿30,000 per eligible parent (age 60+, income < ฿30,000)
└── Law Reference: Revenue Code Section 42(2-6)

Step 3: Progressive Tax Calculation
├── 8-Bracket Structure (0% to 35%)
├── Applied to taxable income after deductions
└── Law Reference: Revenue Code Section 48

Step 4: Social Security Fund (Separate calculation)
├── Rate: 5% employee + 5% employer
├── Maximum: ฿750/month each
└── Law Reference: Social Security Act
```

#### 2025 Tax Brackets
| Income Range (THB) | Tax Rate | Annual Tax Calculation |
|-------------------|----------|----------------------|
| ฿0 - ฿150,000 | 0% | Tax-free |
| ฿150,001 - ฿300,000 | 5% | (Income - ฿150,000) × 5% |
| ฿300,001 - ฿500,000 | 10% | ฿7,500 + (Income - ฿300,000) × 10% |
| ฿500,001 - ฿750,000 | 15% | ฿27,500 + (Income - ฿500,000) × 15% |
| ฿750,001 - ฿1,000,000 | 20% | ฿65,000 + (Income - ฿750,000) × 20% |
| ฿1,000,001 - ฿2,000,000 | 25% | ฿115,000 + (Income - ฿1,000,000) × 25% |
| ฿2,000,001 - ฿5,000,000 | 30% | ฿365,000 + (Income - ฿2,000,000) × 30% |
| Above ฿5,000,000 | 35% | ฿1,265,000 + (Income - ฿5,000,000) × 35% |

### 4. Deduction Calculations

#### Mandatory Deductions
```
PVD/Saving Fund (7.5% employee only)

## 🔄 Payroll Processing Workflow

### Option 1: Standard Payroll Creation (Recommended)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Select Employee] --> B[Choose Pay Period]
    B --> C[Load Employment Details]
    C --> D[Load Funding Allocations]
    D --> E[Calculate Per-Allocation Payroll]
    E --> F[Apply Tax Calculations]
    F --> G[Generate Payroll Records]
    G --> H[Detect Inter-Subsidiary Needs]
    H --> I[Auto-Create Advances]
    I --> J[Complete Payroll Process]
```

**API Workflow:**
```bash
# Step 1: Get employee employment with calculations
GET /api/payrolls/employee-employment-calculated
?employee_id=1&pay_period_date=2025-01-31

# Step 2: Create payroll records
POST /api/payrolls
{
  "employee_id": 1,
  "pay_period_date": "2025-01-31",
  "allocation_calculations": [...] // From step 1
}
```

### Option 2: Preview-First Approach (For Complex Scenarios)

```bash
# Step 1: Preview inter-subsidiary advances
GET /api/payrolls/preview-advances
?employee_id=1&pay_period_date=2025-01-31

# Step 2: Review advance requirements
# Step 3: Proceed with payroll creation (same as Option 1)
```

### Option 3: Simple Tax Calculation (Testing/Validation)

```bash
# Calculate taxes without creating payroll
POST /api/payrolls/calculate
{
  "employee_id": 1,
  "gross_salary": 50000,
  "pay_period_date": "2025-01-31",
  "save_payroll": false
}
```

## 🏦 Inter-Subsidiary Advance System

### Business Scenario
When an employee from one subsidiary (e.g., SMRU) is funded by a grant from another subsidiary (e.g., BHF), the system automatically creates financial advances to ensure proper cost allocation.

### Automatic Detection Logic
```
Employee Subsidiary: SMRU
Grant Subsidiary: BHF
Result: Advance needed from BHF to SMRU

Process:
1. Detect subsidiary mismatch
2. Find BHF's hub grant (S22001 - General Fund)
3. Create advance record: BHF → SMRU via S22001
4. Amount: Employee's net salary for that allocation
```

### Hub Grant Mapping
| Subsidiary | Hub Grant Code | Hub Grant Name |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| SMRU | S0031 | Other Fund |
| BHF | S22001 | General Fund |

### Advance Lifecycle
```
Creation → Pending → Settlement → Closed
    ↓         ↓          ↓         ↓
Auto-created  Awaiting   Manual    Complete
during payroll approval  settlement
```

## üìà Tax Calculation Example

For an employee with:
- Monthly Salary: ‡∏ø50,000
- Marital Status: Married
- Children: 2
- Annual Salary: ‡∏ø600,000

**Deductions:**
- Personal Allowance: ‡∏ø60,000
- Spouse Allowance: ‡∏ø60,000
- Child Allowance: ‡∏ø60,000 (2 √ó ‡∏ø30,000)
- Personal Expenses: ‡∏ø60,000 (40% of ‡∏ø600,000, capped)
- Provident Fund: ‡∏ø18,000 (3% of ‡∏ø600,000)
- **Total Deductions: ‡∏ø258,000**

**Taxable Income:** ‡∏ø600,000 - ‡∏ø258,000 = ‡∏ø342,000

**Tax Calculation:**
- ‡∏ø0 - ‡∏ø150,000: 0% = ‡∏ø0
- ‡∏ø150,001 - ‡∏ø300,000: 5% = ‡∏ø7,500
- ‡∏ø300,001 - ‡∏ø342,000: 10% = ‡∏ø4,200
- **Annual Tax: ‡∏ø11,700**
- **Monthly Tax: ‡∏ø975**

**Social Security:**
- Employee Contribution: ‡∏ø750 (5% of ‡∏ø50,000, capped)
- Employer Contribution: ‡∏ø750

**Net Monthly Salary:** ‡∏ø50,000 - ‡∏ø975 - ‡∏ø750 = ‡∏ø48,275

## üìã Database Schema

### tax_brackets Table
```sql
- id (primary key)
- min_income (decimal)
- max_income (decimal, nullable)
- tax_rate (decimal)
- bracket_order (integer)
- effective_year (integer)
- is_active (boolean)
- description (string)
- created_by, updated_by (string)
- timestamps
```

### tax_settings Table
```sql
- id (primary key)
- setting_key (string)
- setting_value (decimal)
- setting_type (enum: DEDUCTION, RATE, LIMIT)
- description (string)
- effective_year (integer)

```

## üîÑ Data Seeding

### Seed Tax Data
```bash
# Seed tax brackets
php artisan db:seed --class=TaxBracketSeeder

# Seed tax settings
php artisan db:seed --class=TaxSettingSeeder

# Seed all
php artisan db:seed
```

## üîê Security Features

- Request validation for all tax operations
- Permission-based access control
- Input sanitization and validation
- Encrypted payroll data storage
- Audit trails (created_by, updated_by)

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Yearly Tax Updates
1. Create new tax brackets for the upcoming year
2. Create new tax settings for the upcoming year
3. Set previous year brackets/settings to inactive
4. Activate new year configurations on January 1st

### Bulk Updates
Use the bulk update endpoints to efficiently update multiple tax settings:
```bash
POST /api/tax-settings/bulk-update
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tax calculation returns 0**
   - Check if tax brackets exist for the specified year
   - Verify tax brackets are active
   - Ensure income is above the tax-free threshold

2. **Validation errors**
   - Check request format matches the validation rules
   - Verify employee exists in the database
   - Ensure required fields are provided

3. **Seeder failures**
   - Run migrations first: `php artisan migrate`
   - Check for unique constraint violations
   - Clear existing data if re-seeding
